# Beat the Rhythm - Core

This repository was originally developed for and is used by our Virtual Reality rhythm games: [Beat the Rhythm](https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/), [Holodance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422860/Holodance/) and our free beat mapping tool Beatographer (link pending). We share this core part of our rhythm game engine as open source with the community. If you plan to use it in your own projects, please make sure to read and fully understand the license. Also, it would be nice if you let us know.

# Licence

The use of the framework is limited by an exception requiring specific attribution that applies to executable binary builds. See the files [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/narayana-games/Beat-the-Rhythm.Core/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [NOTICE.md](https://github.com/narayana-games/Beat-the-Rhythm.Core/blob/master/NOTICE.md) for details. You may use the contents of this repository both in non-commercial and commercial projects as long as you properly include attribution:

## Attribution

In binary builds (executable applications), on the main UI screen, located so it is visible to players and can be interacted with conveniently, include the text "Powered by:" and our Beat the Rhythm logo in a fair use text size. The logo must have a clickable link to https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/ (in VR games, that link has to be opened in a flatscreen window).

In credits available online, you can alternatively use a text version without the logo:

*Powered by: [Beat the Rhythm](https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/)*

In credits on paper that cannot have links, include the URL:

*Powered by: Beat the Rhythm (https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/)*

This license does not grant any other use of the "Beat the Rhythm", "Holodance", "Beatographer" or "narayana games" branding in any software, resources, advertising or promotion, as this is protected by trademark law where it applies.
