# Beat the Rhythm - Core

This repository was originally developed for and is used by our Virtual Reality rhythm games: [Beat the Rhythm](https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/), [Holodance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422860/Holodance/) and our free beat mapping tool Beatographer (link pending). We share this core part of our rhythm game engine as open source with the community. If you plan to use it in your own projects, please make sure to read and fully understand the license. Also, it would be nice if you let us know.

On the main UI screen, located so it is visible to players and can be interacted with conveniently, include the text "Powered by:" and our Beat the Rhythm logo. The logo must have a link to https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/ (in VR games, that link should be opened in a flatscreen Window). In credits available online, you can alternatively use a text version without the logo: *Powered by: [Beat the Rhythm](https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/)*. In credits on paper that cannot have links, include the URL: *Powered by: Beat the Rhythm (https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/)*.
