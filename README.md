# Beat the Rhythm - Core

This repository was originally developed for and is used by our Virtual Reality rhythm games: [Beat the Rhythm](https://beat-the-rhythm-vr.com/), [Holodance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/422860/Holodance/) and our free beat mapping tool Beatographer (link pending). We share this core part of our rhythm game engine as open source with the community. If you plan to use it in your own projects, please make sure to read and fully understand the license. Also, it would be nice if you let us know.
